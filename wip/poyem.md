    Omen of omnishambles, sleet-darkened skies,
    all London under grey precipitation.
    Some Spring weather. Scarcely seasonal at all.
    The seasons have abandoned their procession,
    dive for extemporaneous cover under downpour.
    Tomorrow's sun will sizzle-dry these same
    sozzled pavements.

    "A situation of total disorder", per Wikipedia.
    The neologism is good to have in hand.
    Some end up soused in mysticism, full of ecstasy
    and fire, farraginously self-misled.
    Some might suppose the nation well-ensorcelled,
    dazzled by gleam in deathless mad Rasputin's
    wondrous side-eye.

    No salvage for those savaged by feral media
    claim slightly-mauled, frontrunning comeback tour.
    Bellum omnium contra omnes has its moments
    of breathless camaraderie, like arena bloodsport
    suspended for celebrity cameo,
    recaptioned image macro drawing egregious
    micropayments.

    I cannot say I saw the point of Dryden
    at nineteen. This likewise may elude you.
    In which case let it go. It may come to you anon.
    Dryden is funnier, or alleged to be.
    Don't judge me by my weakling prosody:
    everyone has their off-day, or decade, or
    ageless aeon.

    Still exercised at odd times in memoriam
    M. F. whom I have now the sense of having
    barely known. The Goldsmiths slogan-mural
    could have been any mid-league social theorist
    of past three decades. Better by far the stuff
    that made them wince, even when opprobrious,
    vampire-weakened.

    No common rhizome routes ergot through to argot,
    syndicate signalling to fruiting brain-rot.
    Goldsmiths is rival turf, its ecosystem
    ill-disposed towards us. Might be guilty
    projection, panic flashes around New Cross.
    By acid he meant psyche-manifesting
    not lysergic.

    Has anyone ever seen it? I mean the psyche -
    topos of affect, global image depot.
    On acid I saw blood gurgling from sewers,
    a floating skull, that sort of thing; then tie-dye
    coloured Mandelbrotian swirls, an anodyne
    enough default. I can get weirder on
    two hours' sleep-debt.

    But he wrote to get seriously defaced,
    make legible the ungovernable within
    our fixed stars' governance, their frozen whim
    our flexible command. Goldsmiths abides
    his punked-out sangfroid, seething like a state.
    The psyche keeps schtum, having with the cosmos
    zero contract.
