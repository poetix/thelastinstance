(an old poem, from July 2008)

    The treatment is pioneering, and never
    more in demand than now
    as in daily dozens the sore-afflicted
    lope
    into reception, thousand-yard-
    staring and gritting their teeth.
    
    In stage one --- diagnosis --- the patient,
    extensively instrumented,
    is prompted to home in on his stress-trigger
    which blooms across the screen
    as it is spoken.
    Graphs are extrapolated, correlations mapped
    by costly hardware in the east
    wing, codenamed
    BRAINIAC --- appropriately, as it too
    is a cluster of very many small
    functions running massively
    in parallel. This takes
    time; the patient is offered
    a glass of water, which he
    invariably slops.
    
    Stage two is treatment. For this
    the patient is strapped down, and a warm
    moist pad laid across the temples.
    Much of what happens next takes place
    outside the field of vision.
    There is
    an intense buzzing, and migraine-
    like aura; ideation follows,
    a fugue of daily life with obscene
    interjections, evidently-
    imaginable horrors
    peeling from the wallpaper.
    This passes; the buzzing persists
    with tiny modulations. Nurses loom.
    The last
    half-hour or so is frankly boring.
    
    The apparatus, referred to in acronym
    exclusively, weakens
    the connections between trauma
    and the life sustaining it.
    Nothing of what happened is forgotten;
    only that it mattered -
    that it had
    to be accounted for, and could not be.
    It dissolves, say its inventors,
    moral problems
    like those of pain and evil, which are not
    in their opinion
    worth half the trouble people take with them.
    "Pain's just a signal; likewise moral pain,
    a crude reflex of early conditioning
    usually received too late to be of value.
    What's eating these guys is emotional
    neuralgia, a maddening
    unscratchable
    itch. Why not just make it go away?"
    
    The project leader gestures through the window.
    Outside young soldiers smile at their young children,
    hold hands with girlfriends, jape
    boyishly with the buddies they came in with.
    "Why not ask them", he says, "if they _feel_
    violated?"
