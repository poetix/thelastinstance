Andrea Dworkin was, in today's parlance, a Big Mood. I don't say this to be dismissive, but to indicate something about the way Dworkin's writing works. It creates a headspace, demands that you enter that headspace, then refuses to let you leave. Even when your head is somewhere else entirely, that space is always tucked away in some fold of the space you're in. You can return to it in an instant, or be yanked back into it with a twitch on the wire. She succeeds by placing everything besides her militant certainty in doubt.

Charlotte Shane is a good writer to interrogate this effect, because she has both allowed herself to be fully subjected to it (which is the only way to read Dworkin, really) and established for herself a headspace which is strongly disjoint from Dworkin's. I often find, reading Shane, that at a certain level I simply don't understand where she is coming from: her headspace is deeply inaccessible to me. It seems strange - it should perhaps seem very strange - that I don't have the same trouble with Dworkin. In terms of my conscious position on things, I'm closer nowadays to Shane's explicit politics than to Dworkin's; but in terms of where my head's at, I can fully understand why someone would look at the entirety of our sexual culture and just say "no", and I can't begin to understand why anyone would say "yes" to some of the parts of it that Shane's chosen to negotiate with.
