naturally I'd hate it if the Khmer  
Rouge were suddenly in power  
and I were sent to starve out in the fields  
or be reformed progressively into a small  
nondescript broken skull  

and naturally I do hate it that  
people do starve in their homes  
under threat of eviction  
certified fit to endure without respite  
ingenious cruelty

the natural way of things is money's way  
as birds in baby beaks drop currency  
as gilded birds strut bravely into traffic  
as feathers swirl amid unswerving traffic  
as silver feathers clog the public drains  
as traffic thunders over matted feathers  
and so on in that unforced sort of way  
that money has when liberal and carefree  
in shining confidence in its terrific  
motorised puissance
