Continuing:

    Still exercised at odd times in memoriam
    M. F. whom I have now the sense of having
    barely known. The Goldsmiths slogan-mural
    could have been any mid-league social theorist
    of past three decades. Better by far the stuff
    that made them wince, even when opprobrious,
    vampire-weakened.

    No common rhizome routes ergot through to argot,
    syndicate signalling to fruiting brain-rot.
    Goldsmiths is rival turf, its ecosystem
    ill-disposed towards us. Might be guilty
    projection, panic flashes around New Cross.
    By acid he meant psyche-manifesting
    stroke lysergic.

    Has anyone ever seen it? I mean the psyche -
    topos of affect, global image depot.
    On acid I saw blood gurgling from sewers,
    a floating skull, that sort of thing; then tie-dye
    coloured Mandelbrotian swirls, an anodyne
    enough default. I can get weirder on
    some hours' sleep-debt.

    But he wrote to get seriously defaced,
    make legible the ungovernable within
    our fixed stars' governance, their frozen whim
    our flexible command. Goldsmiths abides
    his punked-out sangfroid, seething like a state.
    The psyche keeps schtum, having with the cosmos
    zero contract.
