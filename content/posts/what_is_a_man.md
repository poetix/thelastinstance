The present author is, it says here, a man. As much as I prefer to be in situations where this fact has a circumscribed or diminished salience, it inevitably comes up from time to time. Still, for me a large part of the pleasure of reading H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous lay in the demonstration that the scene of _writing_ could be one in which one's psychic undergrowth could be doodled out in all its unclassifiable knottiness. Cixous's _&eacute;critue feminine_ was both a "feminine" writing and a writing beyond gender, a writing in which the distinctness of the not-feminine, the reinforcedly ineffeminate, broke down under a hail of cross-cutting slashes, marks on the page pictured as junctions of desire leading off in multiple directions at once. It's odd in retrospect how much _&eacute;criture feminine_ resembles the erratic, self-retorting, compulsively parenthesised style of the neuroperverse scribe, whose "line" constantly threatens to buckle under the pressure of trying to say all the things at once. Perhaps Cixous's notion that writing can be directed or led forth by divergent libidinal economies makes intuitive sense to the neuro-atypical, but not quite for the reasons posited. "Alterity" means something different to me.

At the level of style -- I'm meant to be writing about something else here, but oh look, a puppy -- I recognise in the laconic twistiness of Naoise Dolan's prose fiction a "relatable" cognitive texture; M. Remi Yergeau's pinwheeling free jazz rhythms speak to me of a queer-autistic mind liberated, at least while it stretches itself out on the _chaise longue_ of writing, from shame and hesitation.
