(continues)

    Forgive me if I go astray, or do not.
    So much of each bright day is sunk in dreaming,
    mazy distraction fractally unspooling,
    attention splintering against attrition,
    you long for boozy rosiness to blossom
    or yoga session leave you luminously
    empty-headed.
    
    The yogi is unclean beneath his robes.
    The roses are advanced in fermentation.
    You picture headspace as a loft apartment,
    well-sunned, from which the cleaners have departed
    leaving a scent of lavender, a sheen
    on every surface, tranquilly awaiting
    yuppie tenants.
    
    Not this arrears- and rodent-ridden bolthole
    where fugitive and half-deranged you quiver
    or, worse, are quite at home, in sloven's Eden
    which no loss ever ransacked, the heaped papers
    aspiring to the ceiling, the floor a lava
    of cast-off underthings, even the very
    walls perspiring.
    
    The psyche, it is said, is unforgetting,
    a chiselled ledger, or a swizzled swirl
    of mingled waters, of which each drop drawn
    contains all others potently diluted,
    non-lethal cocktail from which clarity
    is not forthcoming, even at the point of
    dissolution.
