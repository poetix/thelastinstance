## vii

Let's do this: eschatology uplifts   
scatology; kairotic tweaks erotic.   
Things wildly merge, commit in rush to judgement.   
Stick this under your tongue and wait for razzle-   
dazzle, slow-kindling Heraclitean fire   
not all-consuming, as it is the all, and   
everlasting.   

Envision the last court in disarray,   
submerged in pettinesses; the upright   
Recording Angel overwhelmed with parchment,   
each tort a fractal of recrimination.   
At far-end justice trickles from a spigot,   
distilled and perfectly translucent liquor /   
lethal moonshine.   

Or render judgement binary decision,   
flash of incineration which preserves   
only what tends to rightfulness, all else   
being reduced to scoria, that lump   
of pumice there your hardened and habitual   
fragility, your wilful ignorance all  
blown to ashes.   

Creation is recovering its senses,   
in fields and rivers new intelligence   
adrift or ambling in unsettled pattern.   
Judgement steals into things, unseating habit,   
upending tables. Safes are made for breaking   
from within, by force of ineluctable   
_anagnorisis_.
