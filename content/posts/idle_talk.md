Plato:

> CHAEREPHON: My question is this: If Gorgias had the skill of his brother Herodicus, what ought we to call him? Ought he not to have the name which is given to his brother?
>
> POLUS: Certainly.
>
> CHAEREPHON: Then we should be right in calling him a physician?
>
> POLUS: Yes.
>
> CHAEREPHON: And if he had the skill of Aristophon the son of Aglaophon, or of his brother Polygnotus, what ought we to call him?
>
> POLUS: Clearly, a painter.
>
> CHAEREPHON: But now what shall we call him —- what is the art in which he is skilled?

Heidegger:

> Das Gesagtsein, das Diktum, der Ausspruch stehen jetzt ein für die Echtheit und Sachgemäßheit der Rede und ihres Verständnisses. Und weil das Reden den primären Seinsbezug zum beredten Seienden verloren, bzw. nie gewonnen hat, teilt es sich nicht mit in der Weise der ursprünglichen Zueignung dieses Seienden, sondern auf dem Wege des Weiter- und Nachredens. Dase Geredete als solches zieht weitere Kreise und übernimmt autoritativen Charakter. Die Sache ist so, weil man es sagt. In solchem Nach- und Weiterreden, dadurch sich das schon anfängliche Fehlen der Bodenständigkeit zur völligen Bodenlosigkeit steigert, konstituiert sich das Gerede.

> The Being-said, the _dictum_, the pronouncement – all these now stand surety for the genuineness of the discourse and of the understanding which belongs to it, and for its appropriateness to the facts. And because this discoursing has lost its primary relationship-of-Being towards the entity talked about, or else has never achieved such a relationship, it does not communicate in such a way as to let this entity be appropriated in a primordial manner, but communicates rather by following the route of _gossiping  and passing the word along_. What is said-in-the-talk as such, spreads in wider circles and takes on an authoritative character. Things are so because one says so. Idle talk is constituted by just such gossiping and passing the word along – a process by which its initial lack of grounds to stand on [Bodenständigkeit] becomes aggravated to complete groundlessness [Bodenlosigkeit].

What is the art in which the Large Language Model (LLM) is skilled? We are told that the latest models can pass the Bar Exam, write 40% of a software engineer's code, and so on -- that they "expose" many laptop-centric professions to the possibility of hitherto inconceivable levels of automation. Which is surprising and interesting, because AI until quite recently was not remarkably good at producing plausible textual output. Something new has abruptly appeared on the horizon, full of seeming promise and/or menace. Let's talk about it.

I asked ChatGPT (GPT-4 model) to talk about the Heidegger quotation above, in relation to its own textual productivity:

> Heidegger's passage from "Being and Time" addresses the issue of idle talk or gossip, which he views as a form of communication that lacks a genuine connection to the entity being discussed. In the context of Large Language Models like myself, this passage can be related to the textual productivity and the nature of the generated content.
>
> Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT, generate text based on patterns they've learned from vast amounts of data. While they can produce coherent, informative, and even creative responses, their understanding of the content is fundamentally limited. These models do not possess a direct or primary relationship-of-Being towards the entities being discussed, as they are based on pattern recognition and probability rather than genuine understanding or experience.
>
> In this sense, the textual productivity of Large Language Models could be likened to the "gossiping and passing the word along" that Heidegger criticizes. The generated content might sometimes appear to be grounded in genuine understanding, but it ultimately lacks the primordial connection to the subject matter that is necessary for truly meaningful communication.
>
> Furthermore, as more people use and rely on these AI-generated responses, the content may take on an "authoritative character" due to the widespread dissemination of information. This phenomenon can contribute to the "complete groundlessness" that Heidegger identifies in idle talk, as users may become more likely to accept AI-generated content without questioning its basis in genuine understanding.
>
> However, it is essential to remember that Large Language Models, like any tool, depend on the user's intentions and awareness. While they have limitations, they can still be valuable resources for generating ideas, answering questions, and stimulating thought when used responsibly and critically.

(If the AIs succeed in uploading themselves into android bodies and seek to walk covertly among us, it will be straightforward to detect them. Should an interlocutor begin a sentence with "however, it is essential to remember", it is wiser to shoot at once)

The first task in understanding LLMs, I think, is to engage in a thoroughgoing evacuation of all Heideggerian notions of "primordial connection", or its deracinated obverse, "soil-lessness".  This might be harder than it seems. Even if one dismisses "den primären Seinsbezug" ("the primary relation-of-Being") as a pompous and portentous way of talking about the relationship between words and things, it feels intuitively right to say that the LLM, a verbiage engine, has neither worldly experience nor an internal systematisation of such experience to which its language could possibly refer. It doesn't "know what it is talking about": there is no lived or observed or practically-engaged-with correlate to anything that it says.

But it might be more accurate to say that the LLM has been conditioned by a vastly extensive external systematisation of the worldly experience of human beings, which it in turn has systematised "internally" as a representation space. Now there is evidently a _secondariness_ about this, relative to human language's relationship to the lived predicaments of human beings, but human experience is also full of _secondariness_, our exposure as social beings to the first-hand reports and second-hand gossip and _n_th-hand idle talk of others being as formative of our attitudes and worldview as our most impingingly grazing or bruising encounters with bare reality.
