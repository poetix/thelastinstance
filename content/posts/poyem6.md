If there is saving-power it is in transports  
of respite, of temporary truce between  
world and oneself, oneself and other selves:  
eros and agon both at bay, the moment  
standing open like the Wye's flood-plains'  
flint-stillness glazing out across the hedgerows,  
sempiternal.

I picture us again walking together  
to Brampton Abbotts, me expatiating  
on time and cosmic love as one unfolding  
forecast in Messiaen's _Turangal√Æla_  
_Symphony_, by which I was much taken  
and still am. I may very well have been on  
broadcast-only.

Perhaps not sempiternal. Waters drain.  
Things are in process, as would I have been  
at sixteen, although obstinately patterned  
after my own imago. It is hard  
to learn not one thing from another's kindness -  
a signal failure of the adolescent  
of the species.

Here there are waters rising, not in stillness  
but in excited spate, like Messaien  
jamming the Grand Orgue with stacked harmonics.  
Of time and cosmic love I am uncertain;  
agon and eros both with me contend,  
flashing tremendous teeth, vaulting the sundered  
flood defences.
