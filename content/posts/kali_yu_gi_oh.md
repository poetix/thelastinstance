## iv

    In leafy canopy or gallivanting
    cornfield trespass, twig-strewn woodland track
    to epiphanic clearing, windy rise
    to hilltop menhir, bracing lakeside stomp
    et cetera, you are restored, self-present
    in self-forgetting, Caliban's broad church your
    inner sanctum.

    As children in those wolf-encircled woods
    by dwindling campfire wait for guardians
    from hillside blown or fallen in the lake,
    spreadeagled figures who have lost their hats,
    so amateurs of spirit restively
    sit out the Kali Yuga's unrelenting
    interregnum.

    "Our father", says one, "is a mighty hunter,
    for whom a wolf is nothing but a pelt
    with halitosis". Something nearby starts,
    dashes from patch to patch of undergrowth.
    The youngest sniffles. None will live to morning,
    nor find between those severing incisors
    inward meaning.

    Beautiful creatures though. But so are urban
    foxes, and less partial to your children.
    Iron like irony keeps well at bay
    that distant howling. Foxes rut and screech
    beneath my window, gnaw discarded wings,
    in matters of high spirit not remotely
    interested.
