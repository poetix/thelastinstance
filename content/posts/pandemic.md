I could have called this "6 theses on...", or "scattered observations on...", or something like that, but fundamentally it's a blog post. I'm going to toss out a few sentences on the pandemic, riff on them a bit, finish without really concluding anything. It is what it is.

The pandemic does not have a narrative structure, and therefore cannot "end" in the way a narrative ends. This does not mean that it will be indefinitely prolongued, but rather that it will fuzz out across different phases in different regions, coming into and out of focus. Instead of being a big deal globally and all the time, it will be a big deal locally and intermittently. It's possible that a really nasty new variant will set up a grand return. Alternatively, something else might lunge out of the shadows at us. We were relatively lucky that this particular disease didn't kill children in large numbers. I sometimes wonder how sane anyone in Victorian England can possibly have been, given the atrocious level of infant mortality. Perhaps a society just adjusts to whatever level of uncontrollable tragedy happens to be locally normal.
