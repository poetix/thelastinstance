## v

Rewind clap-backs, in diatribe with absent  
parties maybe irrevocably vacated.  
Scratching deepens the furrow, wearing down  
to aggravated crackle, echoic clucking  
too long after the fact. Keep cutting heads  
for dwindling pay-off; under no circumstances  
change the record.  

What I do in my sleep is less exotic;  
miss people, mostly, or try rescuing  
their shades from roiling Hades, hauling out  
of burning Thames the wrong or some depleted  
phantom no longer answerable for itself,  
the jawbone working tirelessly in vapid  
jibber-jabber.  

The dead forget where they have left their secrets.  
I find that I am losing track of mine,  
confusing them with others', or what everyone  
has always known since book-keeping began.  
At Revelation all accounts unlock,  
decloak, unspool into the heat-dead void like  
rolling credits.  

I mean that the occluded shall be known,  
or that I believe so as a needful  
counterweight to leadenness of forgetting  
and being forgotten, slowly or by fiat  
of curtailment. Somewhere that eschaton  
is self-preparing, seeking out kairotic  
chrono-trigger.
