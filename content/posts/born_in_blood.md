I have been playing _Bloodborne_ for several months now, probably the most I have played any video game besides _Civilisation_ in the past decade. It's a steampunk werewolf story that pivots sharply into Lovecraftian cosmic horror, spreading ontological corruption across a variety of stock locales from creepy forests to echoing catacombs to mad gothic castles. Altars abound; every second building appears to be a cathedral.
