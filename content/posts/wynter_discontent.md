It's worth reading to the end of [this long essay of Sylvia Wynter's on "female circumcision"](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2210&context=caselrev), in spite of any misgivings one might have about its apparent premises or argumentative stance. It _really does_ argue that Western feminists' campaigning opposition to FGM --- along with that of urbanised or bourgeoisified African feminists --- is tangled up in an uninterrogated assumption that femaleness, as a site of physical and moral injury, is a pre-culturally self-evident fact about human bodies, such that FGM can be immediately and unproblematically understood as violence against such bodies: as "mutilation" or "torture", rather than (as male circumcision is more commonly, if not uncontroversially, understood) as symbolic initiation through which the subject is inscribed into human social being. (In choosing to place "female circumcision" in inverted commas here, and FGM not, I'm picking a side of course).

Wynter is not "defending" FGM, as such, but arguing for an understanding of the rationality of its practitioners which is not heedlessly overcoded by Western anthropology; she's accordingly skeptical of Alice Walker's Jungian hermeneutics, in _Possessing the Secret of Joy_, which presents the familiar argument that the practice is grounded in male terror of female sexual enjoyment. It's worth at least reflecting on the severity of genital injury sustained by male initiates under some symbolic regimes, which suggests something other than a fear of sexual enjoyment (and certainly female sexual enjoyment) _per se_. And of course some very urbanised and bourgeoisified people in the West sometimes do or consent to have done extraordinary things to their own bodies out of a variety of motives, of which hatred of their own physical embodiment should not always be presupposed to be foremost.

Wynter's article is a crisp and comprehensive exposition of her cosmology of the "Third Event", which I find useful as perhaps the most baldly stated and explicitly justified version of the underlying culturalism of the humanities: human being is symbolically co-ordinated through and through, such that our "second nature" has fully supplanted our "nature" as biological creatures, and any projection of universal "human nature" is thus the elevation of a particular set of symbolic co-ordinates to the position of "man", or universal humanity, and necessarily entails the dehumanisation of all human beings governed by different symbolic co-ordinates.

This has some odd collateral effects, like placing cultural differences between ethnic groups in the position of ontological dividers: people of culture X having a different sociogeny to people of culture Y are for most purposes _just as different_ as if they had distinct racial essences --- there is a set of pre-determined characteristics that all products of a certain genetic procedure bear, it's just that the genesis takes place within language rather than within the subject's DNA. This doesn't make _no_ difference to things, of course: Wynter's argument against the Western natural-biological schema of human being is that it ontologises a struggle for survival between the fit and the unfit, the selected and the dysselected, and is thus inherently hierarchical. If she is a cultural determinist, she is also a cultural pluralist, for whom there is no stable and super-cultural evaluative matrix within which cultures can be placed and ranked.

If Wynter is a cultural determinist, she is also a believer in the possibility of a transition from being _unthinkingly_ determined, in our social being, by the symbolic co-ordinates of our sociogeny, to adopting something like a consciously pluralist position in which we are able to take stock of the mythemes to which we are beholden, and approach other cultural constellations with due curiosity and respect (rather than just assuming them to be primitive and misguided). Here there is a kind of active paradox in play: Wynter fully believes (as I fully do not) in "cognitive closure", in the complete efficacy of the symbolic inscription which assigns us, upon initiation, to our symbolic place; and yet she also holds out hope for the possibility of a "Second Emergence" in which this closure becomes visible as such, and tractable to a new understanding of human social being in its true diversity, free from any schema of domination. For Wynter, it is the "liminal perspective of alterity" of "members of an intelligentsia of African hereditary descent who are also _women_" which opens the possibility of such an emergence, as this is "the only perspective...that can free us from the cognitive closure defining all human orders". But this rests on a constellation of notions about liminality and cognitive constraint which is not spelled out so clearly, but rather hoisted abruptly into the heavens as a moral lodestar. It will either seem powerfully self-evident to the reader that such an intelligentsia must accede to a world-unmaking perspective sufficient to break out of the cognitive limitations affecting the rest of humanity, or --- not doubt due to those very limitations --- it will not.
