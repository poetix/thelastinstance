This site is statically generated from a bunch of markdown files held in a [git repository](https://github.com/poetix/thelastinstance), and served from a [CDN](https://netlify.com). Pages should load fairly quickly. The site doesn't nag you about cookies, because it doesn't set any. Unless I hear from you, I'll never know you were here.
